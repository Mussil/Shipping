            This simulation introduces an innovative delivery system based on
            the crowds which are already on the road, so they collect packages
            from stations around the city and drop them off at other stations
            towards the destination.<br />
            In this simulation, it is possible to control the number of drivers
            participating in the system as well as the number of packages that
            are expected to be sent and possible customer preferences, thus
            giving it:<br />
            <strong>1.</strong> of packages are shipped<br />
            <strong>2.</strong>number of packages were not shipped<br />
            <strong>3.</strong>cost<br />
            <strong>4.</strong>number of drivers<br />

            This simulation was created as part of a research project in
            software engineering where algo develops an innovative delivery
            system based on packages being delivered by more than one driver, as
            well as the masses - the drivers who travel on the roads anyway at
            another station that brings the package closer to its
            destination.<br />

            In the following pages you can control the parameters that determine
            the number of drivers who will participate in the trip for the next
            2 coming days as well as the number of packages that are expected to
            be sent.<br />
            You can then view the package routes transmitted by the drivers
            according to the above algorithm and get the data describing:<br />
            the amount of packages that managed / failed to reach their
            destination<br />
            the number of drivers who participated in the transfer of each and
            every package<br />
            estimated cost to the customer for a package depending on the
            route<br />
            the length of time it takes for a package to reach its
            destination<br />
            the distance a package travels depending on the route<br />
            And moreâ€¦<br />
